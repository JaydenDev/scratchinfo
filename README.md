An epic scratch stats website powered by SvelteKit and Vercel.

## Developing

Install the node dependencies through `pnpm install` (if you don't have pnpm already, then run `npm install -g pnpm` to get it).
Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`.

## Usage of naming

The project should be either called `Scratchinfo` or `scratchinfo`. Of course, you can use whatever capitalisation you like, but these two are the ones I personally like to use.
