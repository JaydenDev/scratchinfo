# scratchinfo
An epic scratch stats website powered by SvelteKit and Vercel.

## Developing
Install the node dependencies through whatever node package manager you like (npm, pnpm, and yarn, or another one if you want to).
Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`.

# ScratchLight
**Note: A new update to ScratchLight makes it so that there is an expiry time of 5 minutes for each auth session.**

ScratchLight is now only available for scratchinfo now to protect security.
