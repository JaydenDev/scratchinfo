An epic scratch stats website powered by SvelteKit and Vercel.

## Developing

Install the node dependencies through `pnpm install` (if you don't have pnpm already, then run `npm install -g pnpm` to get it).
Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`.

# ScratchLight

**Note: A new update to ScratchLight makes it so that there is an expiry time of 5 minutes for each auth session.**

ScratchLight is now only available for scratchinfo now to protect security.
