# Widgets for Scratchinfo

Thank you for coming to the Widgets area of Scratchinfo! 

## Developing

The recommendation is to use pnpm instead of npm because it is more efficient. If you don't already have pnpm then you can go to [the pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation) to install pnpm.
These are the same as the instructions for developing the main Scratchinfo site.

```bash
# start a development server on localhost:3000

pnpm run dev
```
Now you can start to develop your widget!
Some things to keep in mind:
* Please do not make a free text widget like ocular statuses - those will be implemented later.
